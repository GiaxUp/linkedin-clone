## Description
Hi! In this project me and my teammates worked on a LinkedIn clone made with React. We used some intresting packages like `react-redux`, `react-router-dom` and `react-bootstrap`.

## Main functions
• Personal profile with informations fetched from Epicode's API  
• Change your informatons with a PUT fetch, change your propic with a POST fetch  
• Create your work experiences and add them to your profile  
• Home with fetched posts from Epicode's API, ordered by the last submitted  
• Ability to submit a post with text and image  
• Comments section under every post with the possibility to post, edit and delete comments

## Token info
We decided to hide our tokens into an `.env` file, if you decide to fork this project it will probably fetch nothing!
